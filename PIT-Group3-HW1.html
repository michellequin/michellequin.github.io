                      Masks have become a ubiquitous part of quotidian life in a world wrestling with COVID-19.
                      Facing mounting infection and death rates, many governments have mandated the universal usage of masks in public spaces.
                      Masks come in many different forms and serve different purposes, yet there is not universal compliance of mask wearing in public.
                      Tasked with designing a COVID mask that people would want to wear, our team used a Double Diamond design approach to define the parameters of inquiry, gain insights, and proffer ideas.

                    <p><br>
                      In order to understand what would make a better mask, we first needed to benchmark and identify what types of masks are currently in use.
                      These vary from manufactured to homemade, small to large, single use to reusable, medical-grade to bandana.
                      We surmised that since humans come in many different forms, so should the ideal mask.
                      People have differently sized faces across age and sex.  Some masks might be used for exercise and other for casual daily use.
                      Some masks may serve specific differently abled populations such as the deaf community.  Some value the convenience of ear loops over the comfort of a tied band.
                      In turn, this brainstorming session generated a baseline set of questions to ask during interviews.

                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">USER JOURNEY MAPS/INTERVIEWS</h5>

                    <p><br>
                      A standard set of questions was developed in order to generate insights into the practices and pain-points of using masks.<br><br>
                     <ol type="1">
                     <li>The last time you wore a mask, what type of mask were you wearing?</li>
                      <li> What discomforts do you experience when wearing this mask?</li>
                      <li>What are some of the things you like about your mask?</li>
                     <li>When do you wear a mask?  What did you do while wearing the mask?</li>
                      <li>When do you take off your mask?</li>
                      <li>How did you procure your mask?</li>
                      <li>What masks were other people in your vicinity wearing?  How prevalent was mask usage and what was their behavior?</li>
                      </ol>

                      <br><br>

                      This set of questions was supplemented by follow-up and clarifying questions during the interview.  Overall, these questions are roughly grouped into three categories:
                      a) Before: Process of leaving from the home environment, b) During: Interactions in public related to the mask, c) After: Process of returning to the home environment.

                    <p>
                   <ol type="a">
                   <li> Nicole last left home to eat dinner.  She typically uses an N95 mask.  Initially, these were supplied by the government (10/week) but are now readily available commercially.
                    She stores her mask on a hanger next to her door of egress.</li><br>
                   <li>Nicole notes that most people in her vicinity wear the same type of mask.  She wears a mask anytime she is not in a private space (home/car) or eating/drinking.
                    While eating or drinking in public, the custom is to remove one ear loop and allow the mask to hang, ingest the food or drink, then re-attach the mask while chewing or swallowing the food.
                    Further, she notes that the N95 is uncomfortable during humid weather, but gains a sense of security from masks with a built-in robust filter.</li><br>
                    <li>Nicole will use an N95 mask a maximum of three times.
                    If she has used the mask less than three times, she will store the mask on the hanger.  After the third time, she cuts the straps and disposes of the mask.</li><br></ol>

                    <p>
                      <ol type="a"> <li>Pierre last left home to shop for groceries.  He uses a reusable fabric mask that he purchased from a clothing retailer as part of a bulk order a friend helped organize.
                      He keeps his mask on his desk with other frequented items, namely his wallet and phone.</li><br>
                      <li>Pierre observes that he continually has to push his mask up to stay on his nose.  The mask will become hot after prolonged use.
                      He uses a mask anytime he is in close proximity to someone else outside his ‘friend bubble.’  He takes off his mask while eating or drinking and running outside.
                      He reports that most people in his vicinity wear masks, many wear blue surgical masks or bandanas, but with varying levels of proper compliance.  Often, the mask is worn below the nose.</li><br>
                      <li>Pierre, when he returns home, will place his mask on his desk.  He washes the mask in the washing machine weekly.</li><br></ol>

                    <p>
                    <ol type="a"> <li>Tay last left home to purchase take-out dinner.  He uses various masks including blue surgical masks or a cloth mask.
                    He keeps his mask in the same place, on a table near the entrance to his home.</li><br>
                    <li>Tay notes that cloth masks don’t seem as breathable as surgical masks and does not like that there is no band to hold the mask on the nose in the cloth mask. He prefers the surgical mask for the flexible nose band that fits the top of the mask to the profile of his nose.
                    Tay reports general compliance with mask usage by others in his vicinity, but does occasionally see one or two people not wearing a mask.
                    The also reports most masked individuals use blue surgical masks or cloth masks.  When eating or drinking, Tay will rotate the mask down to his chin by touching the mask surface.</li><br>
                    <li>Tay will use a blue surgical mask about 4 or 5 times before he either disposes of the mask or loses it.
                    Alternatively, he will dispose of the mask earlier if it starts to smell odd.  Otherwise, it is stored face down.</li><br></ol>

                    <p><br>
                        From these ideas, we iterated on several through live sketching and discussion.  One idea, a <b>storage box with integrated ultraviolet lights</b>,
                        is a hybrid of a mask storage container idea and a UV cleaning device.  We envisioned that this device would benefit those that misplace masks but also serve as a way to
                        extend the life of a mask.  We were further concerned with ways to limit the exposure of masks to open conditions when not in use, particularly when not using the mask in public,
                        such as while dining at a restaurant outside.  Using a self-folding grocery bag as a precedent, we propose a <b>self-storage mask</b>; a mask with the ability to fold into itself
                        for safe keeping while not in use.  Finally, to help address concerns about the fit of reusable (washable) masks and heat concerns, we propose a <b>nose bridge</b> that forms to
                        a user’s nose to keep the mask secure, but also pushes out against the mask to create a more generous breathing space between a person’s mouth and the mask.
                        We believe that these solutions cut-across a multitude of concerns addressing material waste, epidemiological effectiveness, and comfort.
